                <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
                <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2024</p>

                <div class="important-notice">
                    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Please Read Carefully Before Purchasing</h2>
                    <p>Due to the bespoke and customized nature of our services, our refund policy has specific conditions that you must understand and accept before making a purchase.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="legal-text">
                    <h2>1. Refund Eligibility</h2>
                    
                    <h3>1.1 Full Refund Available</h3>
                    <p>You are eligible for a FULL REFUND (100% of your purchase price) if ALL of the following conditions are met:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You request the refund BEFORE submitting the onboarding form</li>
                        <li>The refund request is made within 30 days of purchase</li>
                        <li>You have not accessed or downloaded any custom materials prepared for you</li>
                        <li>You have not received any personalized consultation or setup services</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>1.2 No Refunds After Onboarding</h3>
                    <p><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Once you submit the onboarding form, you are NOT eligible for any refund. This policy exists because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We immediately begin creating your customized business package based on your specifications</li>
                        <li>Resources are allocated and work begins on your bespoke setup</li>
                        <li>Custom domains, hosting, and software licenses may be purchased on your behalf</li>
                        <li>Personalized content and configurations are created specifically for you</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. The Onboarding Process</h2>
                    <p>After your purchase, you will receive an email with access to our onboarding form. This form collects essential information including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your business preferences and niche selection</li>
                        <li>Customization requirements</li>
                        <li>Branding preferences</li>
                        <li>Technical specifications</li>
                        <li>Contact and delivery information</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="warning-box">
                        <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> By submitting this form, you acknowledge that you are waiving your right to a refund and authorizing us to begin work on your custom business package.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>3. Why This Policy Exists</h2>
                    <p>Our strict refund policy after onboarding submission is necessary because:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Immediate Resource Allocation:</strong> We assign team members to your project immediately</li>
                        <li><strong>Third-Party Costs:</strong> We may purchase domains, hosting, and licenses on your behalf</li>
                        <li><strong>Custom Work:</strong> All work is personalized and cannot be resold to another customer</li>
                        <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Custom strategies and content are created specifically for your business</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Investment:</strong> Our team invests significant time in researching and building your specific solution</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. How to Request a Refund</h2>
                    <p>If you are eligible for a refund (have not submitted the onboarding form), follow these steps:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Email our support team at refunds@businessbuiltfast.com</li>
                        <li>Include your order number and purchase date</li>
                        <li>State "Refund Request - Pre-Onboarding" in the subject line</li>
                        <li>Provide the reason for your refund request (optional but helpful)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Refund requests are typically processed within 3-5 business days. Funds will be returned to your original payment method within 5-10 business days depending on your financial institution.</p>

                    <h2>5. Exceptions and Special Circumstances</h2>
                    <p>We understand that exceptional circumstances may arise. While our policy is strict, we will consider exceptions ONLY in the following cases:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Technical Failure:</strong> We are unable to deliver the promised service due to our technical issues</li>
                        <li><strong>Misrepresentation:</strong> The service delivered is fundamentally different from what was advertised</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-Delivery:</strong> We fail to deliver your package within 30 days of onboarding submission</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These exceptions are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and require documentation.</p>

                    <h2>6. Partial Refunds</h2>
                    <p>Partial refunds are NOT available. Our packages are comprehensive solutions, and individual components cannot be separated or refunded independently.</p>

                    <h2>7. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
                    <p>Before initiating a chargeback with your financial institution, please contact us first. Chargebacks harm both parties and may result in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Immediate termination of all services</li>
                        <li>Removal of access to all materials and communities</li>
                        <li>Potential legal action to recover costs</li>
                        <li>Reporting to credit agencies if applicable</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>8. Quality Guarantee</h2>
                    <p>While we cannot offer refunds after onboarding, we DO guarantee:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Delivery of all promised components in your package</li>
                        <li>90 days of support to ensure proper setup</li>

                        <li>Resolution of any technical issues with the delivered package</li>
                    </ul>
